# Thyroid Disease Prediction Model

Thyroid disease is a common cause of medical diagnosis and prediction, with an onset 
that is difficult to forecast in medical research. The thyroid gland is one of our body's 
most vital organs. Thyroid hormone releases are responsible for metabolic regulation.
The main goal of our model is to predict the estimated risk on a patient's chance of obtaining thyroid 
disease or not.
